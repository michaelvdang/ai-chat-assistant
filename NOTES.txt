Issues:
- when screen is very short, chat messages on the bottom is covered and not visible even with overflow

COMPLETED:
- set aws credential to run hello.mjs file

TIPS:
- setup openai credentials: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node

- Security token is expired:
  - go to aws console and login with: michael/<password>
  - copy access key
  - run: nano ~/.aws/credentials
  - paste access key with profile name, use dev, as referred to in the bedrockClient
  - refresh server

- ReactGA.initialize not a function:
  - ReactGA does not work with ESModule: "type": "module", so do not use it
